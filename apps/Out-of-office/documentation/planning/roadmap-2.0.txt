Plan of Attack:

- Break apart into minimal chunks (done)
- Refactor individual funtions without worrying too hard about side effects
    - Seperate UI calls and data manipulation
    - Require explicit request for app framework where needed, none where irrelevant
    - Make modules out of logic that isn't specific to app (modal, paginate, ???)
    - Further refactor main app.js, improve event handling
- Document functions, dependencies, and which items are app-framework reliant
    - Investigate docstrings generator for JS?
- Implement unit testing & mocking for functions which perform critical logic
    - Ensure that app framework requirements don't bleed into where it isn't needed
    - Nice to have as an option: Some sort of testing for UI elements as well (will be low priority)
- Get everything back working to v1.0 functionality levels
- Folow up with teammates for feedback & UI Polish
- Squash bugs
- Make Pull request to Master
- Get everything back in sync
- Tag as point release
- Look at pending feature requests for v2
